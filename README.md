# AI Audio Analysis (WIP)
#### Project Description
Project will showcase an AI model's ability to deconstruct songs, predict their metadata, and then possibly make a genre-based or mood-based playlist for a user to enjoy.

## Project Created & Devleloped by:
- Andrew Hernandez (during course)
- William Coleman (currently developing)

## Reasearch Question
How accurately can an AI model predict a song's emotional mood based on extracted audio features compared to human perception?

## Key Results
- Instrument able to be predicted from any given song's audio features. Looking to increase accuracy and the number of predicted instruments.
